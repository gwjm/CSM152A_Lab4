WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net vga/h_count_next_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga/h_count_next[9]_i_2/O, cell vga/h_count_next[9]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT vga/h_count_next[9]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 20 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
