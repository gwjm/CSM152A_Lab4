2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pg/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pg/r_dig0[3]_i_2/O, cell pg/r_dig0[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vga/h_count_next_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga/h_count_next[9]_i_2/O, cell vga/h_count_next[9]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT pg/r_dig0[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    gs/r_dig0_reg[0] {FDCE}
    gs/r_dig0_reg[1] {FDCE}
    gs/r_dig0_reg[2] {FDCE}
    gs/r_dig0_reg[3] {FDCE}
    gs/r_dig1_reg[0] {FDCE}
    gs/r_dig1_reg[1] {FDCE}
    gs/r_dig1_reg[2] {FDCE}
    gs/r_dig1_reg[3] {FDCE}
    gs/r_dig2_reg[0] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT vga/h_count_next[9]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 20 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    vga/h_count_next_reg[0] {FDCE}
    vga/h_count_next_reg[1] {FDCE}
    vga/h_count_next_reg[2] {FDCE}
    vga/h_count_next_reg[3] {FDCE}
    vga/h_count_next_reg[4] {FDCE}
    vga/h_count_next_reg[5] {FDCE}
    vga/h_count_next_reg[6] {FDCE}
    vga/h_count_next_reg[7] {FDCE}
    vga/h_count_next_reg[8] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>
